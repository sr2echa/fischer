# Problem Statement
<p >  
</p>

> Build an AI-powered analyst platform that evaluates startups by synthesizing founder materials and public data to generate concise, actionable investment insights.

# Challenge
Early-stage investors often drown in unstructured startup data — pitch decks, founder calls, emails, and scattered news reports. Traditional analysis is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to missing red flags. What’s needed is an AI analyst that can cut through the noise, evaluate startups like a trained associate, and generate investor-ready insights at scale.

# Objective
Build an AI-powered analyst that reviews founder material and public data to create concise, actionable deal notes with clear benchmarks and risk assessments across sectors and geographies.

# Solution Capabilities
- `Ingest` pitch decks, call transcripts, founder updates, and emails to generate structured deal notes.
- `Benchmark` startups against sector peers using financial multiples, hiring data, and traction signals.
- `Flag` potential risk indicators like inconsistent metrics, inflated market size, or unusual churn patterns.
- `Summary` growth potential and generate investor-ready recommendations tailored to customizable weightages.
